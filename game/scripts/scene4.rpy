  "Rose had arranged to come visit again after a few days and I've made sure I'm here to greet her."

  rose smile_open "Risa!"
  risa dress_smile "Good afternoon. How are you today?"
  rose "Fantastic."
  rose smile_closed "You're looking adorable today!"
  risa "Why, thank you."
  risa "I'm sorry to have you over on such short notice."
  rose smile_open "Don't mention it."
  rose "Is there something wrong?"

  "I rest my cheek on my palm pretending to be constructing my statement in my head."

  risa dress_worried "To tell you the truth, I've got a favor to ask."
  rose "If it's anything I can do."
  risa "I would like to help Ruth out around the house and I would not have much time to spend with Ren."
  risa "I noticed the other day that you're good friends with him and was wondering if you'd be willing to keep him company from time to time."
  rose neutral "Oh."

  "She looks at me as if waiting for a catch."

  rose smile_closed "Oh! Absolutely! It would be an honor."
  risa dress_smile "Really? That would be wonderful."
  risa "I'm sorry to have you involved in this. I just don't know anyone else."
  risa "I know it's my responsibility and all..."

  "She takes a step closer towards me and holds my hand with both of hers."

  rose smile_closed "Don't you worry, Risa. I have you covered!"
  rose smile_open "I've got plenty of time to spare now, anyway."
  risa "Great!"

  "I escort her to Ren's study."

  risa "Rose has come to visit, Ren."
  ren smile "Ah, yes. Come in, Rose."

  "That smile on his face is back."
  "I knew this was the right thing to do."
  
  rose "I hope you don't mind me being here. I've just got nothing better to do."
  ren "Not at all. I'd love to have you over."
  rose "Must be tough being confined in your house on this lovely day."
  ren "I'm behind work. I can't complain."
  ren "What about you?"

  "The warm atmosphere doesn't take long to develop."
  "My presence is just in the way of them."

  risa "Well, then. I'll have to excuse myself."
  rose blush "Aww. You're not joining us?"
  risa "I'm afraid I have to help Ruth out."
  ren neutral "Are you sure? You don't have to."
  risa "I would like to be of any help to her."
  ren smile "Alright, then."
  ren "Don't overexert yourself."
  risa "I'll be sure not to."
  risa "Please enjoy your time together."

  "They continue where their conversation left off almost instantly. It's fun watching them chatter like kids left alone at a park."

  "I take my exit quietly as to not interrupt them and head next door where Ruth is."

  risa dress_smile "Hello."
  ruth stare_open "Madam Risa."

  "I stop her just as she's about to stand and bow."

  risa "It's fine. Don't be considerate of me."
  ruth "I can't do that, madam."
  risa "I know. I'm just not used to being catered to."
  risa "Perhaps you can make an exception?"
  ruth stare_closed "..."
  ruth stare_open "Understood, madam."

  "I would prefer being called by my name instead, but that might be too much to ask right away."
  "At least she agrees not to lower her head every time she greets me."
  "I'd say that's progress."

  risa "Is there anything I can help you with?"
  ruth "I have everything under control, madam."
  risa "I see."
  risa "I am here if you happen to need a hand. I'd be happy to help. I insist."
  
  "She keeps up her professional demeanor but her slight body movement tells me she's still hesitant to give me anything to do."
  risa "Well, can I at least take a seat here until you need me?"
  ruth "By all means, madam. Please make yourself comfortable."

  "I nod and take a seat on her small couch as she goes back to work."
  "The room is surrounded by bookshelves housing a variety of books, each looks more complicated than the last."
  "Does she read all these? Are these for work? Records?"

  ruth "Are you sure about this, madam Risa?"
  risa dress_neutral "About what?"
  ruth "Having Rose over for young master Ren."
  ruth "I'm sure you've caught how he feels about her."
  risa "You think Ren will change his mind?"
  ruth stare_closed "Master Ren would not oppose his parents' pick."
  ruth stare_open "I'm afraid it is you who might change your mind, madam."
  ruth "When that happens, the Yamato would pick the next in line in the selection."
  ruth "That person happens to be the one master Ren is with right now."
  
  "So Rose is the second choice."
  "It must have been a close match."
  "I'm not sure why Ruth thinks I would change my mind, however."
  
  risa "Is that so?"
  risa "I can tell you I don't plan to change my mind at all."
  risa "I'm just letting them spend time with each other."
  ruth stare_closed "Understood."
  risa "Are you sure you don't need my help with anything right now?"
  ruth stare_open "I am just organizing young master Ren's month as much as I can right now, madam."
  risa "Understood."
  risa dress_neutral "That reminds me."
  risa "What does Ren work on anyway?"
  ruth "Young master is a statistical analyst."
  risa "I see. Sounds complicated."
  ruth "He has always had a strong affinity with numbers."
  ruth stare_closed "He's only still young but it won't be long until his parents' friends would start consulting him professionally."
  risa "At such a young age? Is that the family business of Yamatos?"
  ruth stare_open "It is not, madam."
  risa "Is that so?"
  risa "I would have guessed they're all passing down a single profitable family business."
  ruth stare_closed "I'm afraid they don't have such a thing as a family business."
  ruth stare_open "The Yamato family operates under a single simple statement â€” {i}Family, Freedom, and Fun{/i}."
  ruth "Each member of the family is free to pursue what they're passionate about."
  risa "What if someone wants to do nothing?"
  ruth "Then they would do just that."
  risa "That won't be very profitable, would it? How are they able to hold their status for such a long time if such is the case?"
  ruth stare_closed "The answer to that is so simple yet complicated to explain."
  ruth stare_open "To keep it short, due to their basic needs being already met, they are able to focus on doing what they like."
  ruth "If it happens to gather them money, they wouldn't need it for themselves and would instead pass it down to their children to make sure they live comfortable lives."
  ruth "Then the cycle essentially continues."
  ruth "This is why it is important to them that they produce healthy offsprings."
  risa "I see."
  risa "I can't say I fully understand it, but somehow it all makes sense."
  ruth "Since you're now part of the family, the same goes for you."
  ruth "You're free to pursue anything you want."
  risa "I haven't thought much about what I wanted to do."
  risa "I was under the impression that I would be helping around."
  ruth stare_closed "Of course not, madam."
  risa dress_smile "Well, until I figure it out, that's what I'll do."
  ruth "Understood."

  "Turns out there's a lot I still need to learn about the Yamato family."
  "Being with Ruth somehow makes me more comfortable than with Ren."
  "The conversation dies down and my eyes go back to wandering around the room."

  ruth stare_open "Could I perhaps bring you something to drink?"
  risa "Ah!"
  risa "Don't worry. I can help myself."
  
  "I stand up and head for the exit."

  "I happen to pass by Ren's room. I can't help but stop and watch how much fun they're having."
  "Sitting at the corner of the room with such a nice view."
  "I crack a small hidden smile, proud of what I have done for Ren."
  "It was definitely a good idea."

  "I leave them alone for the entire day."
  "Rose starts coming over almost everyday, leaving just before afternoon ends."
  "Everyday, without a fail."
  "Each day she visits, it seems like they have new stories to share."
  "It's amazing."

  "Imagine if they spent everyday like this. Unending smiles and laughters."
  "They look so cute together."
  "They're..."
  extend " almost made for each other."
  "I wonder how Rose feels about Ren."
  "She was a candidate so I'm sure it has crossed her mind."
  "I'm sure she was prepared to develop feelings for him, if she hasn't already."
  "Something I didn't do."
  "If it weren't for me..."
  "..."
  
  "I shake the thought out of my head."
  "In the next few days... No, few weeks."
  "I've preoccupied my time with helping Ruth out."
  "Leaving Ren and Rose almost undisturbed."
