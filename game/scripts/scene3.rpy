  "The following day comes."
  "I find myself standing in front of the Yamato's estate."

  ruth stare_open "Thank you for coming all the way today, madam Risa."
  
  "An unfamiliar woman in a business suit lowers her head as she greets me at the door."
  "I have not introduced myself nor have I told them that I'll be visiting today, but she seems to be expecting me."
  "I lower my head back at her. These formalities may be normal in this household, but I may not get used to it."

  risa dress_neutral "Oh, thank you. I'm here to meet sir Ren Yamato."
  ruth "Of course, madam. Right this way."

  "She steps aside and points with her hand inviting me in."
  "I follow her to what looks like a waiting room more spacious than our family's entire apartment."
  "The doors open directly to the garden."
  "In one corner of the room sits a guy busy with his pen."
  "I recognize him right away even though it's been half my life since we last met."

  ruth "Your fiancée has arrived, sir."

  "The guy looks up and immediately drops his work."
  "He kindly points to the seat in front of him with his palm."

  ren smile "Ah, yes. Please. Take a seat."
  ren "Risa, right?"
  risa "Yes, sir."

  "I sit at the center table cautiously as he's just standing up to join me."

  ren "Just call me Ren."
  ren "We are already engaged, after all."
  risa "Okay, si- Ren."
  ruth "May I get you something to drink, madam?"
  risa "Oh, Uhm..."
  risa "I'm good. Thank you."
  ren "We'll take tea for now, Ruth."
  ruth "Right away, sir."

  "Ruth lowers her head once again as she exits the room."

  ren "We could have prepared something better had we known you were coming today."
  risa "It's fine. Don't mind me."
  ren "Nervous?"
  risa "Just a little bit out of place."
  ren "You are part of the family now. Treat this household as your own and don't hesitate to ask for assistance whenever."
  risa dress_smile "I'll try. Thank you."

  "I glance over at the table he was just at. Papers rustling in the wind are held down by a small piece of rock."

  risa dress_neutral "You seemed to be in the middle of something. I'm sorry to disturb you."
  ren "Nothing to be sorry about."
  ren "Work has just piled up recently. I hope you don't mind the mess."
  risa "Not at all."

  "His kind tone and welcoming attitude make me comfortable despite his rather impassive expression."

  ren "It's really nice to meet you again."
  ren "I heard you were at the top of your class. That's admirable."
  risa dress_smile "That means a lot coming from you."
  risa "I am honored that you have chosen me among all other great candidates."
  ren "It was my parents who did, but I trust their decisions."
  ren "They're not around, unfortunately. No one knows when they'll return yet."
  risa "I see. I should offer them my gratitude when I finally meet them."
  risa "Were you homeschooled?"
  ren "That's correct."
  ren "My parents prefer tutors to ensure that I'm being taught thoroughly in each subject."
  risa "I see. That must be nice."
  ren "I suppose I'm also at the top of my class. That's one thing in common."

  "He cracks a slight smile with that playful comment."

  "Ruth comes in carrying a pot in one hand and a stack of teacups in the other."
  "She courteously places them on our table."

  ruth "Young master, you have another guest today. Should I let her in?"
  ren "Please do."
  ruth "As you wish."

  "Ren pours himself a cup of tea as Ruth stands up and leaves."
  "I'm a bit confused what I should do."

  risa dress_neutral "Should I get going?"
  ren "No, no. It's fine."
  ren "A few people have just been visiting to show their gratitude and blessings."
  ren "It would be better if you're here with me for them to greet."
  risa "Is that so?"
  ren "Why don't you move over to my side?"
  risa "Sure."

  "I walk on my knees to take a seat right beside him as he requested."
  "It's nerve-wracking both being this close to him and having to meet another candidate."

  "Ruth returns, this time with the other guest behind her."
  "She enters the room without waiting for an introduction."

  ren "Hello, Rose."
  rose smile_closed "Hey, Ren! It's been a while."

  "Ruth quietly closes the door behind this energetic girl as she makes herself comfortably seated across from us."

  ren "Would you like some tea?"
  rose smile_open "Sounds lovely, but I'll pass."
  rose "Mom and dad couldn't make it today but I wanted to come visit at all costs."
  ren "That's understandable. How have you been?"
  rose smile_closed "Absolutely great!"
  rose smile_open "And your work?"
  ren "Neverending."
  rose smile_closed "As always, then."

  "They both giggle."
  "She turns to me and finally acknowledges my existence."

  rose smile_open "Ah! You must be Risa!"
  risa dress_smile "I am. Nice to meet you."
  rose blush "So cute! What a lucky guy you are, Ren."

  "I can't help but notice how expressive Ren is right now."
  "From the looks of it, they've been good friends for a while already."
  "Maybe Ren just feels more comfortable with her around."

  rose smile_open "Anyway."
  rose "If I had to guess, other girls have paid you a visit already and I'm here for the same reason."
  rose "I'm really happy for you two."

  "She takes a step back to prostrate herself before us."

  rose "On behalf of my family, I would like to thank the Yamato family for the great opportunity I was given. It means a lot."

  "I am just about to take a bow back instinctively when Ren gently taps me on the knee."

  ren "The pleasure was ours, Rose."
  ren "I appreciate your participation."

  "Rose sits back up with a bright smile on her face."

  rose smile_closed "Have you guys decided when the wedding will be?"
  ren "It hasn't been decided yet."
  ren "We would like to have Risa and her family comfortable with us first."
  ren "It may not be for another year."
  rose blush "Aww. Do let us know once it's set."
  rose smile_open "My parents and I would love to be there."
  ren "We will surely send you an invitation."
  rose smile_closed "Great!"
  rose smile_open "I can't wait to see you in your wedding dress, Risa."
  risa "Thank you. I'm sure you would look better in one."
  rose smile_closed "Don't put yourself down."

  "She helps herself up."

  rose smile_open "Well, then. I have to take my leave."
  ren "Thanks for the visit, Rose. Take care on your way home."
  rose smile_closed "I will. Have a great day!"

  "She bows once more with a big smile and heads towards the door."
  play audio slidingdoor
  "She waves at the last minute before closing the door behind her."
  "The once cheerful room goes quiet."

  risa "Such a lively girl."
  ren "She's always been."
  risa "You two seem close."
  ren "Ah, yes."
  ren "She had kept me company every once in a while."
  risa dress_neutral "Do you like her?"

  "That may have come out of my mouth without me thinking, but I'm curious."
  "He looks at me puzzled for a few seconds before directing his stare outside."

  ren neutral "Does it look like it?"
  risa "Smile never left your face the entire time she was here."
  ren "I don't know much about that, but maybe I am."

  "He massages the bridge of his nose."

  risa "And you're okay with this?"

  "He takes a sip of his tea, but it's obvious he's dodging the question."
  "He gently places the cup back down on the table, playing with it by tipping it just enough for the liquid to reach the edge of the rim."

  risa dress_worried "I'm sorry if I'm prying into your matters."
  ren "It's fine."

  "He continues to play with his half-full cup."

  ren "How much do you know about the Yamato family?"
  risa dress_neutral "Uhm."
  risa "I know about it being the most prestigious family."

  "It doesn't look like that's the response he was waiting for."
  "I try to think of another answer."

  risa "I know that your family values traditions a lot, staying true to the customs that have been passed down throughout the generations."
  risa "I know that you prioritize the physical and mental wellness of your descendants above all else."
  risa "I know that the firstborn gets to inherit everything that gets passed down to the next generation."
  ren "Funny, isn't it?"
  risa "What is?"
  ren "That I get to inherit everything."
  ren "I'm the one to pass down the tradition to my children and so on."
  ren "Even when I'm not even the firstborn."

  "I turn to him, dumbfounded by the news I'm hearing for the first time."
  "I'm not familiar with their family matters to begin with, but what I'm learning right now is not a small matter."
  "The fact that I have not heard of it even as a rumor means almost no one outside their family knows about it."

  ren "I have a brother, you see."
  ren "Much older one."
  risa "May I ask where he is now?"
  ren "Who knows? He cut all ties with us a long time ago."
  ren "You see, he chose to stick with his selfish decision over his duties."
  ren "Chose to be with a woman he loves against my parents' will."
  ren "Against our family's tradition."
  risa "That's... a novel-worthy story."
  ren "It's the first time in our bloodline that something like this has happened."
  ren "Romantic, some would say. Brave, even."
  ren "But I see neither of those. He's a disgrace. Prioritizing his own emotions."
  ren "Our traditions exist for a reason, and we kept our status because of it."
  ren "I am my family's last chance. I won't ruin our tradition for some trivial emotions."

  "He takes another sip."
  "I'm lost for words."
  "Ren's devotion to his family has earned my utmost respect. Though, part of me sides with his brother."
  "I don't think his brother's decision was wrong in any way."
  "I have not experienced love yet myself, but that's not to say I don't understand it."
  "The mere image of wanting to be with someone else warms my heart. It's beautiful."
  "To be deprived of that because of your duties... that must be tough."
  "As much as I would want to know that feeling firsthand, I'm not blessed with a person I feel so strongly towards."
  "But Ren. He knows that feeling and chooses to keep it to himself."
  "Something's just not right."

  risa "What do you feel about Rose?"
  ren "I..."
  risa "Do you want to spend time with her?"
  ren "That doesn't matter now."
  risa "It still does."
  risa "Your dedication to your family is impressive and I can tell you've done a lot."
  risa "You should be allowed to be selfish every once in a while."
  risa "Even if that's just to spend a little time with someone you're attracted to."
  ren "Why is my fiancée asking me to spend time with another girl?"
  risa "I don't see anything wrong with spending time with someone."
  risa "Besides, I think my fiancé deserves happiness before the ring is in place."

  "His hesitant gaze is right at me."

  risa "I've still got a lot to learn around here and the wedding is not for another year as you said."
  ren "Are you really sure about this?"

  "Am I suggesting out of sympathy?"
  "Out of pity? Out of guilt?"
  "My gut tells me this is the right thing to do."
  "Rose can give him something I probably will never be able to."
  "I would be hurt to see him bereaved."

  risa dress_smile "I am."
  risa "I insist."

  "He lets a breeze out through his nose."

  risa "I'll have her requested for another visit soon."

  "Without much opposition from him, I get up and talk to Ruth to do just that."
