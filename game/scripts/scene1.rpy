  "There had once been a time I had dreams. A time I had dared to have hopes of my own in life - to fly free and explore all the world had to offer."
  "How childish I had been… To think that I could escape, to become more than I was."
  "Yet as a child, my folly knew no bounds."
  "My eyes had been glued to the pages of a solitary book; the vibrant colors faded from overuse. The shining white of castles turned to dull gray."
  "I’d once asked my mother what it might be like to live in such a castle."
  "She’d stopped, gently laid down her dishcloth and turned to tell me a story."
  "A realm of banquets, rooms aplenty, and best of all - the home of Prince Charming. A gallant gentleman, she’d said..."
  "Not that nine year old me knew what a {i}gallant gentleman{/i} was."
  "In our city, the Yamato’s were as close to fairytale royalty as we could ever dream of finding."
  "Their land was spacious, their house warm, and their stomachs full..."
  "Everything that ours were not."
  "But how could we ever hope to compare?"
  "Their prestige was unmatched, and their dedication to tradition unrivaled."
  "Even their marriages couldn’t escape their pedigree."
  "What they sought?"
  "Only the finest."
  "And yet somehow - someway - I’d planted a seed in the minds of my parents. That their little girl had dreams of grandeur."
  "To be clad in finery, to lead the life of a princess."
  "It made sense then, that my mother and father would put the wheels in motion. To set me upon a path to a throne for which I barely qualified."
  "My merits?"
  "Simply that I was one of the most intelligent for my age."
  "With near nothing to my name, there was no better way to pass the time than to commit whatever knowledge I could find to memory."
  "Such was how I had gone year after year with only the finest of grades."
  "How convenient, then, that intellect sat at the top of the Yamato’s pecking order."
  "I would have once thought beauty would be key, but every family has their own tastes, and they were no different."

  "..."
  "The reception room is filled with girls my age. Maybe a few are a year older, but that isn’t the biggest difference."
  "Dressed in frills and vibrant colors, these girls chatter away. I can tell many already know one another."
  "Maybe it’s an aloofness I put out that keeps them away, but more likely it’s the patched up clothes my mother had handed me earlier that day."
  "{i}Only the finest for our little princess{/i}, she’d said, combing my hair."
  "I should have known. I have no place at this ball, and I have not the blessing of Cinderella."
  "“I hear he’s quite handsome! He must be quite dashing!”"
  "“Really? My maid told me the young master was the quiet type. Though that’s nothing but servant gossip…”"
  "The talk around me only cements my place here."
  "What could I even offer these people..?"
  "My own lips mutter treason."
  "A glance around shows the candidates forming their own groups, as a hierarchy of extravagance forms... A few of us still stand alone, even one girl who would make a fine addition to any social circle."
  "Her golden hair bobs as she bounces in excitement, even managing to bring a smile to my face."
  "I take a deep breath."
  "Nothing good comes from staying nervous, as my father might say."
  "Between the heat of the room and the chilled drinks covering the tables, a mist covers my glasses. Taking them in hand, I wipe them on my dress..."
  "Only to feel glares from all around burning into my skin."
  "That’s nothing new."
  "The set of doors across the room slide open, their silence a far cry from my own home."
  "How nice that would be!"

  "Through the doorway walks a woman in a most gorgeous suit, but what catches my eye is the young boy walking behind her."
  "After closing the doors behind them, the woman turns to address us."
  "Her words barely register. Isn’t it just polite lip service?"
  "Around me, the other girls seem to buzz with newfound excitement at the mention of a name."
  "{i}Ren.{/i}"
  "With a polite bow, the woman steps aside, offering the stage to the young boy that had entered with her."
  "Though he’s my age, he holds a poise that felt beyond his years."
  "Once more the platitudes wash over me, and I fix my eyes on the boy commanding the room. While nervous giggles flow through the guests, my mind keeps ticking over."
  "His words aren’t important."
  "If anything, the whispers shooting through the room tell me all I need to know."
  "Ren is the prince of this castle; "
  extend "and for the sake of my family, "
  extend "I must be his princess."
