  "Frantic footsteps ring out down the hallway, their owner flying from one room to the next."
  "A quick glance at her wrist brings a subtle frown to her face."

  risa dress_neutral "Ruth?"

  stop sound
  
  "Ren's attendant turns to face me, her worry dissipating in the blink of an eye."
  "If I hadn't just seen it for myself, I would never have guessed anything was wrong."

  ruth stare_open "Oh, Risa, how good to see you."
  ruth stare_closed "You've caught me at a difficult time."
  ruth stare_open "You didn't happen to pass sir Ren on your way in, did you?"

  "I shake my head."

  risa "What's the matter? If there's something I can do..."

  "A moment of hesitation and another glance at her watch is all it takes."

  ruth "If you would be so kind. It's not terribly pressing, only some papers to be signed, but I have my own schedule to keep..."
  risa dress_smile "Shall I find him for you?"

  "Relief wells in Ruth's eyes, but never cracks her composed visage."
  "Professional to a fault, but nothing short of excellent in her work."
  "No wonder she's by Ren's side."
  "But then what of me..?"

  ruth "I'll leave it to you then, Risa."

  "She wastes no time in dashing off, a quick bow offered in parting."
  "What idle thoughts I'd had were scattered."

  risa dress_neutral "Where would Ren be at a time like this?"

  "If it’s Ren, it’s hardly a question."
  "The first port of call would be his study, and with the sun high in the sky, it would be quite the sight."
  "I stride towards his study, bouncing with every step."

  risa dress_smile "Maybe I'm getting to know him better than I thought?"

  "Muffled voices reach my ears from down the hallway. One clearly Ren, but the other..."

  risa "He sounds happy."

  "As indifferent as I am to my future husband, a smile creases my face."
  "Everybody deserves some joy in life."
  "I slide up to the door, peeking through the gap."
  "Inside, a pair of figures shine in the light, a deep warmth embracing them."

  rose neutral "Are you sure you have time for me now, Ren?"
  rose "Last I visited, you told me your schedule-"
  ren neutral "Nothing that can't wait, Rose."
  ren "You needed to see me, didn't you?"

  "There it is."
  "The warm tone that I've never been given."
  "The tone tinged with sadness."
  "The atmosphere is heavy enough to root me to the spot outside."
  "Though Ruth has trusted me to find Ren..."
  "I feel in my heart that I shouldn't... no, I mustn't step in."

  rose smile_open "It's been a while since we enjoyed the sun like this, hasn't it?"
  ren "About two years."
  ren "It feels so long ago, and yet like only yesterday."
  rose neutral "Ren."

  "Her golden locks bounce as she spins on her companion, his eyes widening as the rays of light set her aglow."
  "I don’t dare breathe. The deathly silence that hangs in the air as she calls his name smothers all."

  rose "Are you happy, like this?"

  "He looks past Rose, avoiding her gaze."

  ren "I always enjoy these evenings."
  rose "Ren."
  ren "..."

  "His gaze is pulled back to her unwavering eyes."

  rose "How many more evenings like this might we have? As things are..."
  ren "...It won't last forever."
  rose "Mm."

  "Rose steps closer."

  rose "I'm happy for you, Ren."
  rose "You've found somebody who can share your burden."
  ren "Rose-"
  rose "Does she make you happy?"

  "Ren's gaze drops."

  ren "She's what's best for the Yamato family."
  ren "What I desire doesn't matter."
  ren "I won't become my brother."
  rose serious "Don't talk like that!"

  "Rose snaps back at him, his gaze shooting back to meet hers."

  rose "You might not think there's more to life than your {i}family{/i}, Ren, but don't sacrifice yourself!"
  ren serious "Then what am I supposed to do?"
  ren "You don't know what it's like, having your older brother walk out on you!"
  ren "To hear his decision to elope, as he looks you dead in the eye."

  "For the first time in my life, I hear Ren raise his voice and flinch."
  "Yet, the girl before him stands strong, taking on his rage."

  ren "Do you know what his eyes told me? 'Sorry'!"
  ren "He made it clear to me then and there. I'd lost."
  ren "He sacrificed my future - our future - so he could live his own."

  "Rose’s eyes widen."

  rose neutral "I'm sorry, Ren."
  ren neutral "For what? None of this is your fault, Rose."
  rose "I really blew it, didn't I?"
  rose "If I'd won the selection-"
  ren "But you didn't."
  ren "No amount of regret will change that now."

  "Ren's voice strains as he forces out the words he doesn’t want to say."

  rose "Hey, Ren?"
  ren "...Yes, Rose?"
  rose "Can you see us standing here, just like this in ten years?"
  rose "In thirty?"
  ren "We couldn't. The head of the Yamato's, entertaining a former candidate in private? For so many years?"
  ren "It would be scandalous..!"
  rose "Not if I wasn't a former candidate."

  "She steps closer, closing what little distance still remains between them."

  rose "I'm sure I wouldn't make a bad wife."

  "My throat runs dry, as I refuse to even swallow, lest I make a sound..."
  "Should I interrupt?"
  "If I don't, then what becomes of me? Of my family?"
  "But what of Rose..."
  "I find myself mouthing traitorous words."
  "If only I back down, then Rose would be able to take my place..!"
  "Stuck in limbo, I find myself unable to call out, and unable to walk away."
  "Truly, how pathetic I am."

  ren "I gave my word. To my family, to Risa."
  ren "To not follow through-"
  rose "-would be a shame upon the Yamato's. I know."

  "Rose takes a deep breath, drawing her shoulders back."

  rose "I've always known your pride would come first, but somehow I've found myself drawn to that side of you, too."
  rose "Say, Ren?"

  "She stretches out a hand, gently grasping Ren's arm. His own fingers reach for hers, but curl away."

  ren "What is it, Rose?"
  rose "Can I ask you for one last favor?"
  ren "Of course."
