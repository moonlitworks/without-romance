  "I heave a long and exhausted sigh."
  
  rachel worried "What's with the long face now? Come on, smile."
  risa toga_worried "Ma, you've taken too many pictures. Let's go already."
  rachel smile_open "But it's your big day!"

  "She tinkers with the camera in her hand. Careful as to not accidentally break it."

  rachel "Papa's dying to attend if it weren't for work."
  rachel "He asked me to take as many pictures instead."
  risa toga_worried "One is enough."
  risa "Every other take is just the same face doing the same pose in front of the same gate."
  rachel "Then change it up, silly."

  "Her eyes scan the area and lock onto a group of my classmates fooling around the schoolyard."
  "She points at them with her pinky."

  rachel "There. Do you see them? They're taking lots of pictures as well. I bet you they barely passed their classes."
  rachel "Meanwhile, Miss Valedictorian here thinks she deserves less."
  risa toga_neutral "Grades and pictures are not related. Besides, they're making memories with their friends."
  risa "Mine is just for commemoration."
  rachel "Call your friends, then."
  rachel "I'd be happy to take their pictures, too."
  risa toga_worried "Forget it."
  rachel smile_closed "See?"
  rachel smile_open "Now move to the left a little bit and give me a big smile."

  "The shutter clicks yet again."

  "It's not about the pictures I'm complaining about."
  "It's just embarrassing standing here while all my classmates whose names I already can't remember are passing by us."
  "I'm glad Pa isn't here. There's no knowing how embarrassing this would be."
  "This is a once in a lifetime moment and I know that I should let them indulge."
  "They are proud of my achievements. I understand, and I'm happy that they are. They're the ones I did it for, after all."
  "Perhaps if we'd been taking pictures at home, I would have no qualms."
  
  "My mother clicks her tongue and shakes the device."
  rachel worried "Darn. Batteries are low already?"
  risa toga_neutral "That means it's time to go. At last."
  rachel "I should've brought the charger with me."
  rachel smile_open "Oh, I know!"
  rachel smile_closed "There's a restaurant that just opened nearby. Why don't we treat ourselves there?"
  risa "Don't you need to go to work?"
  rachel "Not for another hour."
  risa "Let's just head home so you can rest before you go."
  rachel worried "You haven't eaten anything since morning."
  risa "I'll cook something myself."
  risa "We don't need to go to a restaurant for that. We don't have the money either."
  rachel smile_closed "Of course we-"
  risa toga_neutral "No, we don't."
  risa "We're already behind rent because of this gown and that camera."
  rachel worried "That's for your Papa and I to worry about."
  rachel smile_open "You, on the other hand, just enjoy today, okay?"
  rachel "You're about to be part of the Yamato family. Money should be the least of your worries."
  risa "Not until the marriage is final."
  rachel worried "So prissy."
  rachel "How are you going to make the Yamato kid like you if you're like that?"
  risa toga_worried "I don't really... have to have him like me..."

  "She sighs, touching her cheek."

  rachel "I've always been worried you're trying to get yourself into something you don't truly understand."
  risa toga_neutral "Like what?"
  rachel "This entire thing. You don't seem to be seeing marriage in the way you should."
  risa "I'm seeing it the way the Yamato's do. I'll be fine."
  rachel "Honey, this is a huge commitment and you seem to be taking it lightly."
  rachel "Marrying someone you don't have feelings for, that's..."
  rachel "You can still kindly decline it and pursue something you want instead."
  risa toga_worried "But this is what I want."
  risa "I've worked hard to get where we are now. I'm not backing out when it's already within reach."
  risa toga_neutral "You've got enough things to worry about already. I can worry about myself now."

  "She shows a dissatsified frown but chooses not to pry any further."

  rachel smile_open "You said you're going there tomorrow?"
  risa toga_neutral "Formally meeting them and introducing myself."
  risa toga_smile "The last time we met was during that big party nine years ago, after all. I would be surprised if he still remembers me."
  rachel worried "I would love to accompany you there, but I..."
  risa "I'll be fine. It's just a visit."
  risa "I might also visit them frequently now that school is over. To know more about what's needed of me and all."
  risa toga_smile "You'll have time to come eventually."

  "Somehow, I've distracted her enough out of the idea of eating out."
  "I pull on her arm and start walking home."
